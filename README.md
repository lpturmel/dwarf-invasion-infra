## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `aws_infra`: The IaC repository for all the deployed resources maintaining the DI infra (Typescript)
- `simAggregator`: The handler responsible for aggregating all the completed sims and posting results to our Discord server (Typescript)
- `simCreator`: The handler responsible for being triggered weekly to initiate all the sims inside the roster (queues the invocation of `simAggregator`) (Typescript)
- `web`: a Sold-Start app for the Dwarf Invasion website (Typescript)
- `webhook`: The Discord Slash command webhook handler (Rust)

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
yarn dlx turbo link
```
